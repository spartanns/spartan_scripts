    "### Switches, Conventions and Encodings\n",
    "Before I can get into what this code means, you need to learn some basics about how data is stored in\n",
    "a computer. Modern computers are incredibly complex, but at their core they are like a huge array of\n",
    "light switches. Computers use electricity to flip switches on or off. These switches can represent 1 for on,\n",
    "or 0 for off. In the old days there were all kinds of weird computers that did more than just 1 or 0, but\n",
    "these days it’s just 1s and 0s. One represents energy, electricity, on, power, substance. Zero represents\n",
    "off, done, gone, power down, the lack of energy. We call these 1s and 0s ”bits.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, a computer that only let you work with 1 and 0 would be both horribly inefficient and incredibly\n",
    "annoying. Computers take these 1s and 0s and use them to encode larger numbers. At the small end\n",
    "a computer will use 8 of these 1s and 0s to encode 256 numbers (0-255). What does ”encode” mean\n",
    "though? It’s nothing more than an agreed upon standard for how a sequence of bits should represent a\n",
    "number. It’s a convention humans picked or stumbled on that says that 00000000 would be 0, 11111111\n",
    "would be 255, and 00001111 would be 15. There were even huge wars in the early history of computers\n",
    "on nothing more than the order of these bits because they were simply conventions we all had to agree\n",
    "on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today we call a ”byte” a sequence of 8 bits (1s and 0s). In the old days everyone had their own convention\n",
    "for a byte, so you’ll still run into people who think that this term should be flexible and handle sequences\n",
    "of 9 bits, 7 bits, 6 bits, but now we just say it’s 8 bits. That’s our convention, and that convention defines\n",
    "our encoding for a byte. There are futher conventions for encoding large numbers using 16, 32, 64,\n",
    "and even more bits if you get into really big math. There’s entire standards groups who do nothing\n",
    "but argue about these conventions, then implement them as encodings that eventually turn switches\n",
    "on and off.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have bytes you can start to store and display text by deciding on another convention for how\n",

    "or 7 bits (or less or more) onto lists of characters kept inside a computer. The most popular convention\n",
    "ended up being American Standard Code for Information Interchange or ASCII. This standard maps a\n",

    "We now have a convention for encoding any characters we want, but 32 bits is 4 bytes (32/8 == 4) which\n",
    "means there is so much wasted space in most text we want to encode. We can also use 16 bits (2 bytes),\n",
    "but still there’s going to be wasted space in most text. The solution is to use a clever convention to\n",
    "encode most common characters using 8 bits, and then ”escape” into larger numbers when we need\n",
    "to encode more characters. That means we have one more convention that is nothing more than a\n",
    "compression encoding, making it possible for most common characters to use 8 bits and then escape out\n",
