    "### Switches, Conventions and Encodings\n",
    "Before I can get into what this code means, you need to learn some basics about how data is stored in\n",
    "a computer. Modern computers are incredibly complex, but at their core they are like a huge array of\n",
    "light switches. Computers use electricity to flip switches on or off. These switches can represent 1 for on,\n",
    "or 0 for off. In the old days there were all kinds of weird computers that did more than just 1 or 0, but\n",
    "these days it’s just 1s and 0s. One represents energy, electricity, on, power, substance. Zero represents\n",
    "off, done, gone, power down, the lack of energy. We call these 1s and 0s ”bits.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, a computer that only let you work with 1 and 0 would be both horribly inefficient and incredibly\n",
    "annoying. Computers take these 1s and 0s and use them to encode larger numbers. At the small end\n",
    "a computer will use 8 of these 1s and 0s to encode 256 numbers (0-255). What does ”encode” mean\n",
    "though? It’s nothing more than an agreed upon standard for how a sequence of bits should represent a\n",
    "number. It’s a convention humans picked or stumbled on that says that 00000000 would be 0, 11111111\n",
    "would be 255, and 00001111 would be 15. There were even huge wars in the early history of computers\n",
    "on nothing more than the order of these bits because they were simply conventions we all had to agree\n",
    "on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today we call a ”byte” a sequence of 8 bits (1s and 0s). In the old days everyone had their own convention\n",
    "for a byte, so you’ll still run into people who think that this term should be flexible and handle sequences\n",
    "of 9 bits, 7 bits, 6 bits, but now we just say it’s 8 bits. That’s our convention, and that convention defines\n",
    "our encoding for a byte. There are futher conventions for encoding large numbers using 16, 32, 64,\n",
    "and even more bits if you get into really big math. There’s entire standards groups who do nothing\n",
    "but argue about these conventions, then implement them as encodings that eventually turn switches\n",

    "\n",
    "Once you have bytes you can start to store and display text by deciding on another convention for how\n",

    "means there is so much wasted space in most text we want to encode. We can also use 16 bits (2 bytes),\n",
    "but still there’s going to be wasted space in most text. The solution is to use a clever convention to\n",
    "encode most common characters using 8 bits, and then ”escape” into larger numbers when we need\n",
    "to encode more characters. That means we have one more convention that is nothing more than a\n",
    "compression encoding, making it possible for most common characters to use 8 bits and then escape out\n",

    "# Memorizing Logic\n",
    "Today is the day you start learning about logic. Up to this point you have done everything you possibly can reading and writing files, to the terminal, and have learned quite a lot of the math capabilities of Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "From now on, you will be learning *logic*. You won't learn complex theories that academics love to study, but just the simple basic logic that makes real programs work and that real programmers need every day.\n",
    "\n",
    "Learning logic has to come after you do some memorization. I want you to do this exercise for an entire week. Do not falter. Even if you are bored out of your mind, keep doing it. This exercise has a set of logic tables you must memorize to make it easier for you to do later exercises.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm warning you this won't be fun at first. It will be downright boring and tedious, but this teaches you a very important skill you will need as a programmer. You *will* need to be able to memorize important concepts in your life. Most of these concepts will be exciting once you get them. You will struggle with them, like wrestling a squid, then one day you will understand it. All that work memorizing the basics pays off big later.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a tip on how to memorize something without going insane: Do a tiny bit at a time throughout the day and mark down what you need to work on most. Do not try to sit down for 2 hours straight and memorize these tables. This won't work. Your brain will only retain whatever you studied in the first 15 or 30 minutes anyway. Instead, create a bunch of index cards with each column on the left (True or False) on the front, and the column on the right on the back. You should then take them out, see the \"True or False\" and immediately say \"True!\". Keep practicing until you can do this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you can do that, start writing out your own truth tables each night into a notebook. Do not just copy them. Try to do them from memory. When you get stuck, glance quickly at the ones I have here to refresh your memory. Doing this will train your brain to remember the whole table.\n",
    "\n",
    "Do not spend more than one week on this, because you will be applying it as you go."

    "# Doing Things to Lists\n",
    "You have learned about lists. When you learned about while-loops you *appended* numbers to the end of a list and printed them out. There were also Study Drills where you were supposed to find all the other things you can do to lists in the Python documentation.That was a while back, so review those topics if you do not know what I'm talking about.\n",
    "\n",
    "Found it? Remember it? Good. When you did this you had a list, and you \"called\" the function append on it. However, you may not really understand what's going on, so let's see what we can do to lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you write `mystuff.append('hello')` you are actually setting off a chain of events inside Python to cause something to happen to the `mystuff` list. Here's how it works:\n",
    "1. Python sees you mentioned `mystuff` and looks up that variable. It might have to look backward to see if you created it with =, if it is a function argument, or if it's a global variable. Either way it has to find the `mystuff` first.\n",
    "2. Once it finds `mystuff` it reads the . (period) operator and starts to look at variables that are a part of `mystuff`. Since `mystuff` is a list, it knows that `mystuff` has a bunch of functions.\n",
    "3. It then hits append and compares the name of all the names that `mystuff` says it owns. If append is in there (it is), then Python grabs that to use.\n",
    "4. Next Python sees the ( parenthesis ) and realizes, \"Oh hey, this should be a function.\" At this point it calls (runs, executes) the function just like normally, but instead it calls the function with an *extra* argument.\n",
    "5. That *extra* argument is ... `mystuff`! I know, weird, right? But that's how Python works, so it's best to just remember it and assume that's the result. What happens, at the end of all this, is a function call that looks like: `append(mystuff, \"hello\")` instead of what you read, which is `mystuff.append(\"hello\")`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the most part you do not have to know that this is going on, but it helps when you get error messages from Python like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Thing(object):\n",
    "    def test(message):\n",
    "        print(message)\n",
    "\n",
    "a = Thing()\n",
    "a.test(\"hello\")\n",
    "Traceback (most recent call last):\n",
    "    File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\n",
    "TypeError: test() takes exactly 1 argument (2 given)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "What was all that? Well, this is me typing into the Python shell and showing you some magic. You haven't seen `class` yet, but we'll get into that later. For now you see how Python said `test()` takes exactly 1 argument (2 given). If you see this, it means that Python changed a.test(\"hello\") to test(a, \"hello\") and that somewhere someone messed up and didn't add the argument for a.\n",
    "\n",

    "### What Dictionaries Can Do\n",
    "Dictionaries are another example of a data structure, and, like lists, they are one of the most commonly used data structures in programming. A dictionary is used to `map` or `associate` things you want to store to keys you need to get them. Again, programmers don't use a term like \"dictionary\" for something that doesn't work like an actual dictionary full of words, so let's use that as our real world example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say you want to find out what the word \"Honorificabilitudinitatibus\" means. Today you would simply copy-paste that word into a search engine and then find out the answer, and we could say a search engine is like a really huge complex version of the *Oxford English Dictionary (OED)*. Before search engines what you would do is this:\n",
    "1. Go to your library and get \"the dictionary\". Let's say it's the OED.\n",
    "2. You know \"honorificabilitudinitatibus\" starts with the letter \"h\" so you look on the side of the book for the little tab that has \"h\" on it.\n",
    "3. Then you'd skim the pages until you are close to where \"hon\" started.\n",
    "4. Then you'd skim a few more pages until you found \"honorificatilitatibus\" or hit the beginning of the \"hp\" words and realize that this word isn't in the OED.\n",
    "5. Once you found the entry, you'd read the definition to figure out what it means.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process is nearly exactly the way a dict works, and you are basically \"mapping\" the word to its definition. A dict in Python is just like a dictionary in the real world, such as the OED."
